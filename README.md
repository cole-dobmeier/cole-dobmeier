# Who I am
Hello! I am Cole Dobmeier and I am a teen living in Colorado and I am an aspiring Computer Science Student. In college I plan to study Computer Science and the related fields and deepen my knowledge. At [Epic Campus](https://littletonpublicschools.net/schools/epiccampus/welcome), an innovative pathway that provides crucial first person experience in many pathways. In the Computer Science pathway we have visited a multitude of colleges and learned about python, the depths of AI, and how to use code to manipulate real world objects. If you have any questions about what you see below, please feel free to email me at [cwd495@gmail.com](mailto:cwd495@gmail.com)!

### 2. [Raspberry Pi Stoplight](https://github.com/cole-dobmeier/Stoplight-Projects.git)
**Description:**  
Created a virtual circuit in Tinkercad to simulate a stoplight with three LEDs powered by simulated 3V coin batteries. Following our Tinkercad models, we transformed these circuits into physical circuits on Raspberry Pi's.

**Features:**
- GPIO pin control via Python
- Screenshot of the Tinkercad circuit provided.
- Button operable Stoplight, timed appropriately to a real Stoplight
- Included top-down wiring photo and a video demonstration. 

**Technologies:**  
- Tinkercad Circuits
- Raspberry Pi & Breadboard Circuitry
- Python Programming
